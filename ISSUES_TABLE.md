# Issues Table - Static Code Analysis

This table documents the issues identified by static analysis tools and how they were fixed.

| Issue Type | Tool | Line(s) | Description | Fix Approach |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Missing module docstring | Pylint | 1 | No docstring at the beginning of the module | Added comprehensive module docstring explaining the purpose of the inventory management system |
| Non-snake_case function names | Pylint | 7, 12, 17, 23, 28, 33, 38 | Function names not following snake_case convention (addItem, removeItem, etc.) | Renamed all functions to snake_case: `add_item`, `remove_item`, `update_quantity`, `get_item`, `list_items`, `search_items`, `generate_report` |
| Missing function docstrings | Pylint | 7, 12, 17, 23, 28, 33, 38 | No docstrings for functions | Added comprehensive docstrings with Args and Returns sections for all functions |
| Dangerous default value | Pylint/Bandit | 38 | Mutable default argument `logs=[]` creates shared state bug | Changed to `logs=None` with conditional initialization inside function |
| Use of eval() | Bandit | 26 | Critical security vulnerability - arbitrary code execution risk | Replaced `eval(quantity)` with `int(quantity)` for safe integer conversion |
| Bare except clause | Pylint/Bandit | 44, 47 | Generic except catches all exceptions including system exits | Changed to specific `except KeyError:` to catch only relevant exceptions |
| Old-style string formatting | Pylint | 50-53 | Using % formatting instead of f-strings | Converted all string formatting to f-strings for better readability |
| Missing file encoding | Pylint | 35, 40 | No encoding specified when opening files | Added `encoding='utf-8'` to all `open()` calls |
| No context manager for files | Pylint | 35, 40 | Files not properly closed if exception occurs | Used `with` statements for automatic resource cleanup |
| Line too long | Flake8 | Various | Lines exceeding 79 characters | Split long lines appropriately while maintaining readability |
| Trailing whitespace | Flake8 | Various | Extra spaces at end of lines | Removed all trailing whitespace |
| Unused import | Pylint | 1 | Imported `logging` module but never used | Removed the unused import statement |
